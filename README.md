# FilmQueryProject

## Description

The film Query project is a project where I used the JVM to run and execute code in a SQL database by connecting to the appropriate driver. 

## Technologies Used

- Java
- SQL
- DriverManager
- MacBook

## Lessons Learned

While working on the film query project I learned how to incorporate SQL and Java together to reach a solution. I made several methods to retrieve different sets of data to help the user find exactly what they were looking for. I also learned how to connect to a driver and execute querys within that driver.
